            <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
            <p>
              The common interest that members of the Association share is to
              inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
              play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
              referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
              disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background,
              expertise, accomplishments or standing.

            <h3>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>DIMENSIONS.</b>
                <p>
                  IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                  within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                  dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams
                  under 12 and older.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b>
                <p>
                  Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum
                  of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations
                  participating in the state competition program that are unable
                  to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must
                  advise the State Competition Board which will assign its
                  Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the
                  Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should
                  be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that
                  are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to
                  play all their games away.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</b>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no
                    penalty areas. Fields for older age groups should be
                    progressively larger.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards
                    width.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards
                    in width.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their
                    internal dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.
